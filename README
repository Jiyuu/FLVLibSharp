A relatively simple FLV library written in C#



This lib is extremely basic and was written mostly because I was searching for a comfortable way to Read FLV metadata directly in C#
After searching for a while I found some basic implementation but it was wrong and failed when i tried it,
So I just decided to code my own implementation based on the FLV spec file by adobe.

This is very much a work in progress, I only implemented 3 FLV data types (string, number, array), 
So there is a high probability it will crash when you use it, but I tried to make it easy to implement the missing bits.


For reference please you the FLV spec file I attached to the repo,
The E section is about FLV.
And the most of the relevant missing implementations are in E.4.4.X

P.S.
While I wrote this mostly for metadata it should be possible to implement the full spec of FLV in this in case this is what you are searching for.
